RESTful api are stateless i.e. they do not save the state(user).
to check if the user is the one who he is claiming to be...is the user genuine...
in rest api server do not save anything about user....
when content of page changes then we need a machanism to authenticate...
so that a user do not need to login again and again and can use the protected route again and again
all the data needed for authentication is saved in cookies...

----first time signup or login---{
when client sends request ,then the user is added to databse(for signup only) and the database returns a 
1.unique key(specified by us/programmer[what type of key he wanna use]) ex. the _id and we use this as a 
payload + 2.we also have the header info given by server and this header consists of algorithm used for 
encryption ex.  SHA256 and its decrypter ex. JWT..
3.along with these 2 server has a special secret key (it is only avaliable to server) 

when all 3 are combined a value is formed which is encrypted by the server using the algorithm and a 
object containing the (header,payload,encrypted signature) is sent back to the client (auth token) 
JSON object which is used in form of cookie...

and when client sends a request for the profile or anything related to a user with this request it sends
its cookie for the authentication and the server again makes a new signature by using the client-payload
+client header + server key it creates a new signature and if this signature matches with the signature 
sent in the client request(from cookie) then user is authenticated otherwise it is not.
